### What is an API?

APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.


### What does API stand for? 

API stands for Application Programming Language. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.

### Keywords 

`HTTP`

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It's a set of rules that allow web browsers and servers to communicate with each other. HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web.

How HTTP works: 

* A web browser sends a HTTP request to a server.
* The server sends a HTTP response back to the browser.
* The browser is called the "client" and the server-browser relationship is called a "client-server" relationship.
