### What is an API?

APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.


### What does API stand for? 

API stands for *Application Programming Language*. In the context of APIs, the word *Application* refers to any software with a distinct function. *Interface* can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.

### Types of API

### HTTP Request Methods

### What is Apex? 

Apex is a strongly typed, *object-oriented programming language* that allows developers to execute flow and transaction control statements on Salesforce servers in conjunction with calls to the API. Using syntax that looks like Java and acts like database stored procedures, Apex enables developers to add business logic to most system events, including button clicks, related record updates, and Visualforce pages. Apex code can be initiated by Web service requests and from triggers on objects.

### Keywords 

`HTTP`

HTTP stands for *Hypertext Transfer Protocol*. It's a set of rules that allow web browsers and servers to communicate with each other. HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web.

How HTTP works: 

* A web browser sends a HTTP request to a server.
* The server sends a HTTP response back to the browser.
* The browser is called the "client" and the server-browser relationship is called a "client-server" relationship.

`CRUD`

*C*reate, *R*ead, *U*pdate, *D*elete are the four basic functions that models should be able to do, at most.


`cURL`
